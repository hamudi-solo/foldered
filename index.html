    <h2>A journey beyond the myths</h2>
    <p><b>Everyone</b> in the village knew the stories: the forest beyond the northern ridge was <u>cursed</u>. They said no one who entered ever returned, that strange <u>lights</u> floated between the trees at night, and <u>whispers</u> followed those who came too close. Children were warned never to wander near, and most adults pretended it didn’t exist at all.</p>
    <p>For in the heart of the forest lay a clearing where an ancient tree stood — its bark etched with symbols glowing softly in the twilight. Elia felt a warm pulse from the tree, as if it were alive and breathing. She reached out, placing her hand on its trunk, and a rush of memories flooded her mind — visions of people who once protected the forest, of forgotten magic, and a promise that one day, a brave soul would come to restore its light.</p>
    <p>Elia knew then that her journey was only beginning, and the forest had chosen her to be its new guardian.</p>
